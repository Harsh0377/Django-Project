<h4>Brief Explanation of Project</h4>
<p>First we have to create a Django project and Django app within the project. Configure it as per your choice. Then implement a form that allows users to upload "csv files". Perform Data Processing use pandas to read the uploaded csv and perform some basic data analysis task such as Display few rows of the data, Calculating summary statistics operation like mean, median and then identify and handle mising values. Perform Data Visualization like generate plot using seaborn such as Histogram for numerical column and display the plot on web page. Finally create simple and user-friendly interface that display the data analysis result and visualization in organized manner using Django templates. (Note: Above video (Demo.mp4) is the final result we get after doing the project.)</p>
